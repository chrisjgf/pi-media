# pi-media

I created this as a weekend project during the initial corona-days. 

This spins up a super-lightweight backend in order for the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the media server. It then exposes methods for use by the iOS companion app. The app shows a list of items on the server, selecting one allows the user to then download, play, or delete the file.
